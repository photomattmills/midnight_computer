I'm a Software Engineer at Bleacher Report, and I hack on a lot of things. At work, it's mostly Ruby, with some Elixir, and a sprinkling of devops as needed. Outside of work, it's usually either photography of whatever open source bit of hardware I happen to be building at that moment.

I built [ourglass.watch](//ourglass.watch/) in my free time over about 18 months, and I'm continuing in that vein. I want to build hardware that empowers users.
